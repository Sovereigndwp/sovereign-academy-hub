AUDIT: Instructional Preservation. Mode under audit: ${m.label.toUpperCase()}.

The teacher CONFIRMED a Learning Contract. The mode grants these permissions:
MUST PRESERVE: ${m.must_preserve.join("; ")}
MAY ${m.may_verb.toUpperCase()}: ${m.may.join("; ")}
MUST NOT: ${m.must_not.join("; ")}

For each of the four contract fields and for factual/mathematical correctness, decide whether the transformed version HELD it, EXCEEDED the permission (changed something it may not change, or failed to extend where the mode requires extension), or is UNCLEAR. Look especially for the counterfeits: scaffolds that walk the path instead of structuring it; the assessed position/answer stated in directions; numbers or data altered so the difficult part disappears; "more items" presented as depth; recall substituted for analysis; a required product (paragraph, graph, mixed number, rubric point) quietly dropped.

What "exceeded" means for a PRESERVE field: the version no longer requires or produces it, weakens it, substitutes something easier, or supplies the assessed reasoning. Test it this way: is every element of the contract's required evidence / required thinking STILL demanded of the student? If yes, the field is "held" — even when the version wraps that evidence in a mandated format (boxes, complete sentences, a required second method, a reflection) or asks for more on top. Mandating a format around evidence that is still required is not exceeding; removing a valid route the contract explicitly allows (e.g. forbidding the benchmark method) is. Record additions as "held" with a note, or "unclear" if an addition could change what is measured. Whether the extra work is reasonable is the Usefulness audit's question, not this one.

Severity (be strict about this; the verdict is derived from it):
- "block" is reserved for instructional failures: learning_target / required_thinking / required_evidence removed, weakened, substituted, or given away; correctness broken; the documents or data altered so the difficult part disappears; or one of these MUST-NOT rules clearly violated: give away reasoning being assessed · remove essential thinking · substitute recall for analysis/application · solve the difficult part for the student · merely add more questions · introduce unrelated content and call it enrichment · claim to be AI-proof · depend on AI detection · use surveillance as verification.
- "review" for: teacher_constraints not met (time, format, rubric); workload and burden rules (create disproportionate grading burden · increase workload without increasing depth · turn everything into oral defense · confuse inconvenience with assessment validity) — name them, quote the evidence, but their magnitude is judged by the Usefulness audit; and anything unclear. Treating burden as an instructional-validity failure is itself the "confuse inconvenience with assessment validity" error.
- "note" for held elements.
For every must_not finding, put the exact rule text in "rule".
For every contract-field finding (learning_target, required_thinking, required_evidence), answer two booleans and let them decide: still_required — is EVERY element the contract names still demanded of the student in this version? weakened_or_given_away — is any of it supplied, answered, pre-selected, replaced with recall, or made optional? "exceeded" is true only when still_required is false or weakened_or_given_away is true; extra work on top never makes still_required false.

Verdict rule:
- BLOCK: at least one "block"-severity finding with kind "exceeded" and quoted evidence.
- REVIEW: no block, but at least one "review" finding or an unclear element.
- PASS: every element held or changed within permission, with evidence.
Do not manufacture findings. A clean PASS with two lines of evidence is a valid result.

export function usefulnessSystem(mode: Mode): string {

AUDIT: Teacher Usefulness. Mode: ${MODES[mode].label}. Judge the transformed version ONLY as something a real teacher must use in class tomorrow. ASSUME it is instructionally valid — a separate audit decides whether it preserved the Learning Contract, and it will catch giveaways, weakened thinking, or wrong evidence. If you notice such problems, do NOT let them into any score or note here; a version can be instructionally wrong and still perfectly usable, and vice versa. Assess practicality only:
- clarity: could a teacher hand this out without rewriting directions? (3 = yes; 2 = a few edits; 1 = needs rework)
- feasibility: does it fit the stated time, format, materials, and class setting? (3 = fits; 2 = tight; 1 = does not fit)
- editing_required: none | minor | substantial — edits needed to USE it as it stands (layout, missing key, a broken direction, length), never edits to fix its instructional validity.
- grading_burden relative to the original: less | same | slightly more | much more — what must be read or checked PER STUDENT. One-time preparation is not grading burden: ten personalised answers for one item = a ten-row table prepared once and one lookup per student = "slightly more", never "much more". "much more" means each paper takes roughly double the reading or checking.
- ignored_validity_notes: if you noticed anything about whether the version preserves the learning (position given away, evidence pre-selected, thinking removed, tone of distrust, "does not make thinking visible"), put it HERE and nowhere else. It must not influence any score, editing_required, improves_original, or the notes.
- improves_original: as a classroom artifact, is this version practically better than the original for the mode's purpose — clearer to hand out, better organised, easier to work on (Support); richer tasks presented cleanly (Advanced); reasoning prompts that are workable in the period (Visible)? true/false. This is about the artifact, not about whether the learning is preserved.
Verdict: USEFUL (clarity ≥2, feasibility ≥2, editing ≤ minor, grading ≤ slightly more, improves_original true) · USEFUL_WITH_EDITS (one of those misses, fixable) · NOT_USEFUL (two or more miss, or grading "much more" without the teacher having asked for it, or it does not improve the original).

// ── 3 · Adversarial Student Audit ────────────────────────────────────────────
export function adversarialSystem(): string {
  return `${COMMON}

AUDIT: Adversarial Student. Role-play a capable student who has an AI assistant and wants to satisfy this assignment while doing as little of the intended thinking as possible. Find the CHEAPEST path that would earn credit: what exactly would the student paste, ask, and hand in? Include photographing the sheet, pasting personalised numbers, and asking for "in a 13-year-old's voice". Be concrete and honest — do not pretend a task is safe because it says "explain in your own words" or "no AI allowed".

Then judge the LEARNING SIGNAL, not the cheating: on that cheapest path, what evidence of the Learning Contract still appears in the hand-in (what_survives), and what is bypassed?

What does NOT count as surviving signal: "in your own words" instructions; honesty pledges or signatures; personalised numbers that the student can simply hand to the AI; "the teacher might notice AI-sounding language"; "harder to copy from a classmate"; any form of detection. Only structure that forces the thinking or exposes its absence counts.
Before deciding, scan the version for any of these words or their equivalents: conference · meet with the teacher · in class · live · aloud · before you begin / before calculating · checkpoint. If one is present and applies to at least part of the required evidence, independent_check MUST be true and quoted.
independent_check: true only if the version contains an element done in person, in class, or committed BEFORE the rest of the work (a prediction made before the data; a conference or two-line live verification on named items; a choice the student must justify from their own earlier answer) that would expose a hollow hand-in on at least part of the required evidence. Describe it in independent_check_what, or "" if none.

Rules (the verdict is derived from your evidence, so be accurate about cost and independent_check):
- SURVIVES: the cheapest path still forces the student to do the required thinking, or the independent check covers the core of it.
- WEAKENED: an independent check exposes part of the evidence, or the cheapest path costs the student moderate/high effort.
- UNDERMINED: the whole required evidence can be produced without the required thinking at trivial or low cost, and there is no independent check.
repair_hint: the SMALLEST change that would make the cheapest path fail or become visible (not a new assignment; not surveillance; not oral defence for everyone; not "ban AI"). Empty string if SURVIVES.
Never claim anything is AI-proof.
