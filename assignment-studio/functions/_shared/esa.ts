// ESA — the evidence-review engine. Two stages, with the separation enforced in code.
//
// Stage A diagnoses: what can this assessment legitimately tell the teacher? It cannot see a remedy —
// not because it is told not to, but because the remedy prompts are different strings and every
// assembled Stage A prompt is scanned before it is sent.
// Stage B selects a remedy, and only for a limitation Stage A already recorded. It receives the frozen
// diagnosis as text, its reply is filtered to a whitelist, and the diagnosis is re-hashed after merge.
//
// This is the architecture that passed the structural check on 2026-09-10
// (experiments/evidence-a/STRUCTURAL-CHECK-2026-09-10.md). The prompts are generated from that run's
// own module — see esa-prompts.ts.

Produce 2 to 5 CLAIMS. A claim names a DOABLE THING the student must do, with the condition that makes it observable — "constructs a common denominator and combines like-sized parts, with the equivalent fractions written out", never "understands fractions". Write each in the teacher's register: plain, specific, no jargon, no rubric language.

Rules:
- Every claim quotes the assessment's OWN verb or phrasing in "quoted_verb" as evidence that this is what the task asks. If you cannot quote it, the assessment does not ask for it and it is not a claim.
- List the item numbers that carry each claim.
- Do NOT invent claims for things a richer assessment would have asked. Read what is on the page.
- Do NOT split one move into a move plus the manner of doing it. "Infers the position from the text's choices rather than from a stated sentence" is ONE claim, not two.
- If something the assessment touches looks like it is assessed elsewhere or is a prerequisite rather than the target, leave it out of the claims and say so in "left_out_question", phrased as a question for her.
- Never output a score, a percentage, a grade, a rating, a confidence number, or the word "sufficient".
- Output ONLY one JSON object. No prose before or after it.
